<h3><b> Elevator pitch about me! </b></h3>

<img id="portrait" src="{{site.baseurl}}/../assets/images/portrait.jpg" alt="Portrait of me">
<h3>
Hi, my name is <u>David Purdy</u> and I am a <u>Junior Computer Science</u> student at <u>Rose-Hulman</u> Institute of Technology. My interests tend to be lower level such as OS or micro-controller level programming, but I have done a little bit of everything from database management, web-development, a decent bit of full stack, a lot of computer engineering, and fun random topics like NLP. But I am usually willing to try just about anything that involves problem solving since that is really what got me into computer science/software engineering. With my last year or so of college I am looking to explore some different areas that interest me and so I have been taking a couple computer engineering classes because I think it would be fun to look at a bit more hardware as well as software.

<h3><b> A little more about me </b></h3>

Besides that my interests involve music, mainly synthesizers and effects, but I also own way too many guitars and always love to talk about that or just music in general! I love weight lifting and running, playing sports, kayaking, and trying new things my friends are passionate about.

I started this site as a portfolio site to host my resume and projects, but I am also going to start writing about problems that I face at
work, school, or for fun here has well so hopefully you can avoid the hours of mistakes that I am inevitably am going to make! So feel free to check out my resume page, blog, or my github as well to see some of the things I have been working on.
