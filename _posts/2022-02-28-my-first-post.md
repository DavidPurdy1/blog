Hi y'all this is my first post on this website. I decided that I wanted to create some posts over projects that I have done this quarter at Rose as well as a couple in the past and what I have learned from then! 


For a project in my computer architecture class, we were tasked with doing research on a certain computer and/or CPU and because we study MIPS and some similar load/store architecture, I decided to do a ARM chip and because I actually already owned a Raspberry Pi 4, presenting on some of the specs would be easier.

### Introducing the Pi 4

The Raspberry Pi 4 is the newest product by the Raspberry Pi foundation and starting at $35 for the 2GB ram version is an incredible deal for having a straight out of the box linux machine, but I am sure that you're all aware of the Raspberry Pi. 

The Raspberry Pi has an impressive performance increase from the 3B+ of about 1.5x more computational power. This allows the computer to almost feel usable when doing things like browsing the internet etc. Currently I have one right now as a media center for my tv at school because there are many open source softwares that you can use to play older games and play media. Using [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/) I was able to play some older Game Boy Advanced Games that I played as a kid, but it was a real letdown that despite the 1.5x improvement and many other things like multiple execution pipeline, it could still not emulate GameCube and Wii graphics to the onboard graphics chip well enough to play the games with any reasonable framerate. 


## Final Paper
